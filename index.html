		Hello {{ username}} !
		<br><br>
		The Written Declaration 54/2009 that needs signatories from the European Parliament ( see <a href=http://www.worldhorsewelfare.org/help-tomorrow/long-distance-transportation>details</a> ) has better chances of getting signed if you ask your MEP. On the web - see link above - there are pre-written templates you can paste in your email client, and spreadsheets from which you can fish out the email addresses and names of MEPs to target. But that can take minutes!
		<br>

		This site lets you send a pre-written email to all the MEPs using your GMail account if you have one. Your password stays safe, everything happens at Google's servers. It takes about 42 seconds. <br><br>
		<form action='/mail' method='get'>
			<label>Please enter your full name, to be added to the end of the email message</label>
			<input type='text' name='username' value='alma'><br>
			<input type='submit' value='Send emails to MEPs'>
		</form>
